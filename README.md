# Smiling into Ready, Set, Action!
This program was made for TOHacks 2021.

##Inspiration
Our inspiration came with our realization that many subtle joys of life are ignored because we have grown overstimulated, and thus rarely satisfied with our day to day lives. We look foward to vacations or parties, so when that is no longer an option, we feel morose and fatigued. Instead, we should pay attention to the chirping birds, the warm sunlight; peer into the puddles on the street, and see another world beneath the shimmering ripples. So start smiling, and you too will view life from a fresh perspective, and notice these minute, but beautiful details. :)

##What It Does
Bring together a group of friends and smile in front of the camera. Once everyone in the group is smiling, our software will automatically take a photo after 3 seconds.

##How We Built It
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a website template, however, we implemented the main functionality in Python due to time constraints and bugs. Face bounding and smile detection were implemented using OpenCV.

##Issues
opencv.js was being quite finicky, so we ended up using python. Thus we couldn't integrate the software into the website. We wanted to allow users to create accounts and allow them to keep a collection of their photos to remind them of better times, however that wouldn't get implemented.
